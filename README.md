# PyPhysicsEEBlog
This is blog of a Physicist masquerading as a Programmer, pretending to be an EE 

I am just starting this blog and would rather host it via Github. I am writing these in the Jupyter notebook and then exporting the notebooks to HTML. I will figure out how to make this more blog looking but for the moment this is the best I can do; after all, I am mainly a physicist masquerading as a programmer so a lot of these less math and science things make little sense to me.
